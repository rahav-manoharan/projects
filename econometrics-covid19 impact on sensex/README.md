This repo contains shareable parts of the project completed towards fulfilment of requirements for the *Econometrics for Consultants* course, IIMB 2021

COVID-19 is known to have affected the global economy with varying degrees of impact in various countries. Although there are many indicators of economic performance, onb of the most reactive and immediate indicators of economic activities in a country is the stock market of that country. It is also for each country's stock market to have 1 or more indices that each have their own properties/constituents.

In this project, we aim to understand the economic impact of COVID-19 by modelling the performance of SENSEX (which is a [market-weighted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalization-weighted_index "Weighted-index") index of the Bombay Stock Exchange). To do this, we first select a [functional form](https://cmapskm.ihmc.us/rid=1052458916298_870839951_7777/Functional+form#:~:text=A%20functional%20form%20refers%20to,and%20regressors%20or%20explanatory%20variables.) and collect data on those variables. We then understand correlation and variable importantce to eliminate unnecessary variables and simplify the functional form of the regression equation.
